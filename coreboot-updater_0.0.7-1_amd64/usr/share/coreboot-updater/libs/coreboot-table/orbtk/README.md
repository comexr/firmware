## Usage

To include orbtk in your project, just add the dependency
line to your `Cargo.toml` file:

```text
orbtk = "0.2.26"
```

However you also need to have the SDL2 libraries installed on your
system.  The best way to do this is documented [by the SDL2
crate](https://github.com/AngryLawyer/rust-sdl2#user-content-requirements).

## Examples

You find the examples in the `examples/` directory.

You can start the adventure example by executing the following command:

```text
cargo run --example widgets
```
